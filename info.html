        <h2>Pacific Coast Music Festival is a music festival that does not exist but if it did exist it would take place somewhere on the Pacific Coast. This music festival idea was created so I could learn about different features of developing websites. Click on the tickets tab to find out ticket prices and click on the lineup tab to see the different artists that will be playing this year. This festival will take place in the summer at a beach near you!</h2>
